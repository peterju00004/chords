# Chords

To run: `npm run dev`

### TODO:
- Detection:
  - Deal with notes with dupliucate names (e.g.: "C2" and "C3").
  - Rearrange notes to fit within <1 octave>? (have to determine the specific bound).
  - More patterns of chords and drop fifth voicing
- UI:
  - 3D Keyboard
  - Minor alignment issues.
